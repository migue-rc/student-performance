# --- Shared theme styles -----------------------------------------------------
# brand-theme.css is loaded LIVE from the deployed site (see _quarto.yml), so it
# never needs copying. The SCSS theme partials, however, are compiled per-site by
# Quarto and must exist locally at build time — they cannot be a remote URL in
# `theme:`. These targets bring them in from the main repo.
#
# SHARED  (fetched/overwritten — do NOT edit): sketchy-light.scss sketchy-dark.scss
# LOCAL   (your overrides — never fetched, safe to edit): custom.scss

# Theme partials to keep in sync (only these are ever overwritten).
